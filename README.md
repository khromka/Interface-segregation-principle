# Interface-segregation-principle

This repository demonstrates a clean application of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in C++ by decomposing user capabilities into focused, minimal interfaces.

Project Structure
Connectable.hpp – Interface for connection-related behavior
AdminActions.hpp – Interface for admin-specific actions
User.hpp – Base class implementing shared user logic
AdminUser.hpp – Implements both Connectable and AdminActions
GuestUser.hpp – Implements only Connectable
ConnectionManager.hpp – Operates on Connectable interface
main.cpp – Entry point showcasing interface-based polymorphism
Requirements
Compiler: Tested with MSVC v19.44 (Visual Studio 2022)
C++ Standard: C++17 or higher
Usage Example
AdminUser admin(1, "Dmytro");
GuestUser guest(2, "Olena");

ConnectionManager manager;
manager.connect(admin);
manager.connect(guest);

admin.banUser(guest);
